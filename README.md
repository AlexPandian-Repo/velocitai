I assume that you all will have been aware how to run a project on local host using xampp, So I will tell you the further steps.

1.Put all the files in htdocs as it is.
2.Make a database named ecomphp and import ecomphp.sql file to this database to dump all the tables.
3.All things are done now its just plug and play run the index.html file on localhost.

      Thankyou!..
